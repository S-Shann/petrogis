<h3>The information system was developed as a part of the Russian platform 2018.<br>
    Data array used on the website was compiled by the Department of Archaeology of the Ghent University
    within the framework of the
    <a href="https://www.ugent.be/lw/archeologie/en/research/research-projects/altay-project.htm" target="_blank">project
        for the study of landscapes of the Altai Mountains in 1995-2018 (AMSP)</a>.<br>
    The source database of AMSP project contains more than 16,000 records, including mounds, stones, kereksurs,
    balbals, virtual dwellings, deer stones etc.<br>
    During the one-month work of Russian Platform Short-term Fellowship Program,
    from the database were extracted about 320 rock art records of Turu-Alty region. Almost all of the
    extracted records represent photo images, taken in the field; geographic location, with an accuracy of 20-40 cm;
    a brief description.<br>
    For a content management system to manage data was chosen a prototype product,
    developed at “Multidisciplinary Research on Prehistoric Art in Eurasia” Lab of
    Novosibirsk State University. Preparing, integration and adaptation of data and information system
    was performed by Vladislav Kazakov, researcher at Novosibirsk State University, as part of the
    Russian Platform program of invited researchers at University of Ghent.
